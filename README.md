# didkduk.io Transliteration Editor Project
Capstone Project - Intro to CS Fall 2023

dikduk.io is a transliteration editor that flags potentially misspelled transliterated Hebrew and Yiddish words. Users load a .txt file they want to edit and the program will flag potentially incorrect words. After users make and save their edits, a new edited .txt file is saved and document stats are displayed in the GUI. 

### Features:
**File Handling**: Supports opening, editing, and saving .txt files containing transliterated text.
