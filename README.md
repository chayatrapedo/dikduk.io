# didkduk.io Transliteration Editor Project
Capstone Project - Intro to CS Fall 2023

dikduk.io is a transliteration editor that flags potentially misspelled transliterated Hebrew and Yiddish words. Users load a .txt file they want to edit and the program will flag potentially incorrect words. After users make and save their edits, a new edited .txt file is saved and document stats are displayed in the GUI. 

### Features:
- **Text Editing**: Users can edit transliterated text files by making changes to individual words.
- **File Handling**: Supports opening, editing, and saving .txt files containing transliterated text.

### Instructions:
- Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the GUI.
- **Start Screen**: Enter the file name of the .txt file you want to edit.
- **Edit Screen**: Navigate through the text, make modifications, and use buttons for navigation and saving.
