Educating Mankind: The Seven Noahide Commandments
The farbengen held on Shabbat HaGhdol, Parshat Metzora, 5746, also celebrated the 84th birthday of the Rebbe. [The Rebbe’s birthday actually occurred on Sunday, the 11th of Nisssan, but this farrengen was viewed as the official celebration.] In his discourses on that day the Rebbe acknowledged the proclamation issued by President Reagan and the U.S. Congress, concerning the duty of mankind to observe the Seven Noachie Laws. The Rebbe also expressed his approbation of the proclamation establishing “Education Day” on the 11th of Nissan (the Rebbe’s birthday) and its connection to Shabos HaGadol. In this excerpt the Rebbe explains the importance of encouraging gentiles to observe the universal, Seven noachide Laws and the importance of teaching and inculcating the future generations to follow the Seven Noacide Laws. Successful, global education depends on love, brotherhood, personal example, sincerity and dedication. The world can become a place where all people will serve G‑d together.
Everything Begins With Torah
Tradition teaches us that everything in creation finds its source in Torah. The zohar describes it this way:
The Holy One, Blessed be He, looked into the Torah and created the world, so man looks into the Torah and keeps the world alive. (Zoar II, p. 161b)
Moreover, we find cases when true Torah sages made halachic rulings based on Torrah and as a result certain changes took place in worldly matters.
There is a well-known story told of the Ragachover Goan, who was called the “Prince of Torah” by the Rebbe Rashabb and the previous Rebbe.
The Ragachover once received a letter from the government tax department which described two types of taxes which he was being charged. He studied the bill and the explanations and then said that one form of tax was legitimate on the basis of the Torah, and therefore should be paid in accordance with the dictum, “The law of the government is law” (Gittin loc. cit.). However, he pointed out, that the second tax was not acceptable by Torah standards and should not be paid (see Ramam, Laws of Robbery, 5:14).
Torah Rules — The World Conforms
Several days passed and a second notice arrived. This time the tax department apologized for making a mistake in the previous tax\ bill and admitted that he was not liable to pay the second tax!
Quite an extraordinary occurrence! In “that” country, which opposed all aspects of Judaism, Torah and mitzvos, and in the city of Leningrad, where many important government ministries were situated, and where the protocol of government bureaucracy was carefully adhered to, the Ragachover’s Halachic ruling, based on the Torah’s truth, caused the government to withdraw its demand for taxes — truly amazing!
The incident was all the more astonishing when we remember that in “that” country, once someone was assessed a tax it was virtually impossible to rescind the assessment, yet here they recalled the tax bill and apologized!
The power of a Torah ruling can change the way the world functions; against its own nature.
Unlike this story there are many rulings of Torah which already exist and need not be judged anew. One exemplum would be the ruling of Rambam:
Moreover, by Divine ordinance, Msohe, our teacher, commanded us to compel all human beings to accept the commandments enjoined upon the descendants of Noch. (Rambem, Laws of Kings 8:10)
Torah Rules — The Jew Performs
This means that every Jew is responsible to encourage the non-Jewish denizens of the world to act in accordance with the Seven Noachide Commandments.
In the olden days there was great potential danger involved in this type of activity — for it could be misconstrued as an attempt to proselytize. In our generation, however, there is no danger in this respect, and it will increase the honor and respect shown to Jews among the other nations. For they will see that the Jews are concerned with the welfare of all peoples, for the world was “formed to be inhabited,” which will only be when society follows the Divine plan.
As a result, the gentiles will extend their help to Jews, also in matters of Yidishkeit.
In this country there is an additional incentive, since the President has issued a proclamation urging and encouraging the observance of the Seven Noachide Laws. He has indicated that only in this way can the world remain inhabited and civilized. By issuing this proclamation during the month of Nissan, close to Shabbat HaGadol — the Great Shabbos — when we commemorate the miracle of “striking Egypt through its firstborn,” the President’s proclamation emphasizes the revelation of G‑dliness through the essence of the corporeal world. It also lends support to disseminating the Seven Noachide Laws among all humanity, for after the President has made this proclamation it is easier for every Jew to influence a gentile whom he comes in contact with in his business, profession or social group.
When We “Receive” We Must Also “Give”
When a Jew deals with a non-Jew and finds the opportunity to do some business with the gentile, in a sense, to “receive” his “livelihood” from the gentile, he must also “give” something. It may be said that the true reason for their association is to teach the non-Jew the Seven noachide Laws. In addition, when he carries out this role properly he will find more respect in the eyes of the gentile and automatically there will be positive results with regard to his business dealings.
It is therefore appropriate to express our appreciation to the Government of the United States and to its head, the President, for this proclamation regarding the Seven Noachide Laws. At the same time we must express our gratitude to the Holy One Blessed be He that our government represents a benevolent republic, which extends assistance and aid to the Jewish people in all areas of need, including matters of Yiddishkeit; and even Chabad Chasidut! The first act in that respect was to help gain the release of the previous Rebbe from “that” country. This set the stage for the continuous expansion of Chabad Chassidus through the previous Rebbe to the rest of the world, till Masheach’s days.
Hopefully, our Jewish brethren will understand the generous attitude of this benevolent republic and will appeal for, and request, more help from the benign government; surely they will see even more good results.
Education Day — U.S.A.
The President has also issued a government proclamation designating a day in the month of Nisan (11th, the Rebbe’s birthday) as “Education Day.”
Since the laws of Noach are basic and elementary, e.g. not to rob, not to murder, to believe in God etc., it is obvious that these laws must be taught to children so that they should grow up righteous and good. Consequently, we must improve and adapt the educational system in America to properly transmit these principles and values to the next generation. In fact, in the Seven Noachide Laws we find the commandment for education:
The duty is enjoined upon them to set up judges in each district to deal with these six commandments and to caution (educate) the people. (Ramam, Laws of Kings 9:14)
Teach The Laws Of Noach To All
Clearly they must teach the people to know and to live by the Laws of Nuach.
The foundation and basis of the Seven Noachide Laws — is love and brotherhood. Even the word Noah indicates: pleasantness and friendliness. And when non-Jews observe the Seven Noahide Laws they are called “pious (righteous) gentiles,” which indicates kindness and love.
In reaching out to encourage the observance of the Seven Noachide Laws we must also show kindness and emphasize the goodness and pleasantness which their observance will bring to the world and society.
In general, education must also be approached with love and cooperation, a child must always be brought close with the right hand:
A child...thrust (him) away (only) with the left hand and draw (him) near with the (stronger) right hand. (Sotoh 47a)
This means that even when the child needs chastisement, do it only with the left hand, with restraint, while at the same time reach out to assist him with the right hand.
For a teacher to be successful he/she must speak to his/her students with words that emerge from the heart, for only then will they penetrate the heart and accomplish their goal. Most importantly, teachers must always remember that the first principle of education is that the teacher must be a living example, many times over.
May it be the will of Gd that we soon see the complete perfection of the world, when all people will serve G‑d together, as is emphasized towards the close of the “Sederr.”
The door is opened, to remember that it is a protected night . . . a night which protects the children of Israel in all generations — to redeem them from this diaspora. And if Eliyehu comes he will find the door open and we will go out and greet him more quickly...in the merit of this faith, Mashiakh will come. (Shulhan Arch HaRav, Laws of Pesach ch. 480)
And then all the nations of the world who have assisted the Jewish people will join in the worship of G‑d:
And they shall bring, all your brethren out of all the nations, an offering to the Lord...as the children of yesrael bring an offering in a clean vessel to the house of the L‑rd. (Yeshaya 66:20)
So may it be for us among all the Jewish people, that we may greet Mahiach speedily and truly in our days.
